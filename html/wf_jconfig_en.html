<b>Descriptions</b>:
configuration parameters jail
<br><p> Each cell has its own rc.conf file in <i><b>$workdir/jails-rcconf/</b></i>, own the fstab file for a list of mounted file systems in the directory<i><b>$workdir/jails-fstab/</b></i> and 
its own directory to store the statistics, descriptions of jails, configuration wizards and other supporting files in a directory <i><b>$workdir/jails-system/</b></i></p>
</p>
In the TUI-dialog can be brought, not all possible configuration options jails, in which case they can be corrected in the corresponding files via any text editor when jail is stopped
<br>
<h3>Jails IP address</h3>
IP addresses that are bound to the jail sets in <i><b>$workdir/jails-rcconf/</b>rc.conf_name</i> file in the parameter <b>ip4_addr</b>.
As an IP may serve as IPv4, and the IPv6 address. When starting and stopping jail, working with IP may take place in two modes -
automatic on-the-fly creation of IP addresses for the jail at the time of launch + automatic removal from the interface IP when stopping or
the use of previously initialized IP addresses.
<p>
When for jails assigned to more than one address, they should be listed separated by spaces or commas. IP can include network prefix specified
through IP/<b>prefix</b>. By default, aliases created with the prefix /32, that may not be appropriate if the jail uses a separate subnet from the network server - in
this case, the correct <b>/prefix </b> is needed.

<p>
The parameter that controls this behavior stored in <i><b>$workdir/jails-rcconf/</b>rc.conf_name</i> file
and called <b>interface</b>. If it is not in <b>rc.conf</b>-file or the value is 0, jstart and jstop will not be called
ifconfig alias and ifconfig -alias, respectively. If its value is 1, before jail start, this command will be executed:
<pre>
ifconfig <i>alias</i> <b>interface</b> <b>ips</b>,
</pre>
and when jail stop:
<pre>
ifconfig <b>inteface</b> <b>ips</b> <i>-alias</i>
</pre>
Be careful with this option, if you have only one IP for server that is used and this IP is assigned to the same jail:
when stopping jail, ip address of the server will be removed automatically that will make the server unavailable. In this case, you need to use in jail rc.conf:

interface=0

or just remove "interface" parameters from jail rc.conf.

An example of a piece of configuration to create three IP addresses at the start of the jail:
<pre>
..
interface=1
ip4_addr="176.9.147.18/29 2a01:4f8:160:3002::1/64 192.168.0.2/24"
..
</pre>

<h3>Mounting File Systems in jail</h3>

Each jail has own fstab file, which lists the file systems that are mounted in a jail at startup. This file is located in the file
<i><b>$workdir/jails-fstab/</b>fstab.name</i> and coincides with the syntax of the file system format <b>/etc/fstab</b> with the exception that, as the mount point indicated
path relative to the jail root, not the master system. For example, if you want to jail1, which is located at
<br>
/usr/jails/jails/jail1 
<br>
on the master host, mount tmpfs for /tmp jail dir  (those actually in /usr/jails/jails/jail1/tmp from master filesystem), then the entry in the
<i><b>$workdir/jails-fstab/</b>fstab.jail1</i> should look like this:
<pre>
..
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw 0 0
..
</pre>
