<b>Commands</b>:<br>
<pre>
% cbsd jstart jname=jail1 jail2
% cbsd jstart jail1 jail2 ... jailX

% cbsd jstop jname=jail1 jail2
% cbsd jstop jail1 jail2 ... jailX
</pre>

<b>Description</b>:
<br>
<p>Running jails occurs at startup cbsd/server automatically if parameter <b>astart</b> in the corresponding jail file
<i><b>$workdir/jails-rcconf/</b>rc.conf_name</i> set to 1.
When you stop the server or service <b>cbsd</b>, all running jails will be stopped automatically.
</p>
<p>Starting the jail manually by the command:
<pre>
 cbsd jstart jname=jail1
</pre>

or

<pre>
 cbsd jstart jail1
</pre>

or

<pre>
 cbsd jstart jail1 jail2 jail2 ..
</pre>
(to launch multiple jails by one command)
</p>
<p>When <b>parallel=0</b> is set in <i><b>$workdir/</b>nc.inventory</i> and you try to launch/stoping a few jails, start/stop will be held consecutively.
It is not always good, as any error triggered inside jails in the rc-scripts, which leads to a pause, can block start/stop next jails.
<p>
In the case when <b>parallel</b> have a non-zero value, each next jails will be launched/stopped in N seconds after the previous one, where N - <b>parallel</b> value.
When on this timeout previous jails does not have time to run/stop completely, the next jails will be executed in parallel.
</p>
<br>
<p>
To stoping jail <b>jstop</b> must be used, with the same syntax and behavior:
<pre>
 cbsd jstop jname=jail1
</pre>

or

<pre>
 cbsd jstop jail1
</pre>

or

<pre>
 cbsd jstop jail1 jail2 jail2 ..
</pre>
(to stopping multiple jails by one command)
</p>
<p>
With a large number of jails (particularly databases, with services such as MySQL, redis, cassandra, etc.), it should be borne in mind that the low value <b>parallel</b> (for example, less than 5 seconds)
can generate a very intensive storage I/O load that can increase the amount of start-up time of all jails, than if they were run sequentially or higher timeout.
</p>
<p>Additionally, when a shutdown command is running on the server with lots of jails/services that should be taken into consideration low timeout that defaults to perform rc.shutdown sequence.
In this regard, the process <b>init(8)</b> can interrupt the rc-scripts on this timeout, resulting in abnormal shutdown jails. In this case, the database can lead to
nonconservation or damage data. To avoid this, <b>/etc/rc.conf</b> master system should be adjusted parameter <b>rcshutdown_timeout</b> to a more reasonable value (default: 90 seconds)
</p>
<p>
In the absence of <b>rcshutdown_timeout</b> in the system <b>/etc/rc.conf</b>, <b>cbsd initenv</b> will put this option in its sole discretion automatically.
</p>
Also, keep in mind that when using the zfs features (<i><b>$workdir/</b>nc.inventory</i>, the parameter <b>zfsfeat=1</b>), and the file system ZFS, at jstop, file system of jails will be
unmounted and those catalog <i><b>$workdir/</b>jails-data/jail1-data</i> will be empty. If in such a case when jail data is requires without running it,  by the command <b>zfs list</b> You can see the name
 appropriate file system and run zfs mount <b>fs</b>.
