<p>Each jail of cbsd has its own settings which is used for starting and stopping the jail.
This page contains a summary of the default settings and description.
<hr>
<pre>
jname="jail1";
</pre>
Immediately, the unique name of the jail. This is the name that can be seen on the <b>cbsd jls</b>  command or in the inventory list of nodes.
This field can not be changed manually. If you want to change the name of the jail please use <b>cbsd jrename</b> command, because the name of the jail
used in many other settings and on the file system directory naming
<hr>
<pre>
path="/usr/jails/jails/jail1";
</pre>
Indicates the path that will be used as the root at the start of the jail. The above configuration is characteristic of jails
who are setting baserw to 0 (no write access in base), ie, the base of which is mounted in read-only.
In this case, the algorithm will work jstart follows:
<br>
<br>1) mount a base via nullfs specific version (see below) to  /usr/jails/jails/$jname directory
<br>2) on the mounted base at $workdir/jails/jails/$jname mount directories related directly to the jail data (in the directory $workdir/jails-data/$jname), usually in write access
<br>3) start jail with the root $workdir/jails/jails/$jname
<br>
<br>If baserw=1, then nullfs not use and the jail immediately starts with the directory $workdir/jails-data/$jname as root. In these cases, the path is usually seen as a
<br>
<br>path="/usr/jails/jails-data/jail1-data";
<hr>
<pre>
host_hostname="jail1.my.domain";
</pre>

FQDN, the full name of the jail. This field can not be changed manually. If you want to change the name of the jail please use <b>cbsd jrename</b> command
<hr>
<pre>
ip4_addr="10.0.0.5/24";
</pre>

IP address of the jail. If you plan to use multiple IP addresses, they are separated by commas:

ip4_addr="10.0.0.5/24,192.168.0.2/30,54:04:a6:b2:11:c4/64";
<hr>
<pre>
mount_devfs="1";
</pre>

Mount a devfs file system into the jail (directory /dev). Most services without this simply can not work.
<hr>
<pre>
allow_mount="1";
</pre>

Allow users or services mount other file system inside the jail
<hr>
<pre>
allow_devfs="0";
</pre>

Allow users or services mount devfs file system inside the jail
<hr>
<pre>
allow_nullfs="0";
</pre>

Allow users or services mount nullfs file system inside the jail
<hr>
<pre>
mount_fstab="/usr/jails/jails-fstab/fstab.jail1";
</pre>

The path to a file containing a list of directories or file systems to be mounted with the jail when it is run
<hr>
<pre>
arch="amd64";
</pre>

Jail architecture (and respectively base from the $workdir/basejail)
<hr>
<pre>
mkhostsfile="1";
</pre>
Whether correct in jail /etc/hosts entry 
<br>$ip4_add $jname $jname.my.domain
<br>
in accordance with the IP address and the name (FQDN) of jail
<hr>
<pre>
devfs_ruleset="4";
</pre>
a set of rules devfs, which will be applied to the devfs file system in the /dev of jail (list of rules in the file /etc/devfs.rules of master node)
<hr>
<pre>
interface="auto";
</pre>
This recording controls the behavior of the automatic creation and deletion of IP addresses on the interface or use the previously established .
<br>
<br>The value <b>auto</b> means that cbsd will select the interface on which to create an IP address jail.
<br>For example : there is a node with two interfaces . 
<br>At the interface igb0 set IP subnet 10.0.0.2/24 and while the default gateway for the server is 10.0.0.1, in consequence of which igb0 a network card, through which the traffic by default. at the interface
igb1 registered IP/subnet 192.168.0.1/24. 
<br>If the jail in rc.conf ip4_addr takes value 192.168.0.{1-255}, then cbsd automatically selects 
igb1 interface for IP jail. 
<br>If none of the interface is not the subnet that contains the IP jail will be selected by default interface .
<br>
<br>Also, the value can be set to the name of the interface, if you do not want to search for a suitable interface. For example record
<br>
<br>interface = "igb0"
<br>
<br>sets the IP address of the jail at the interface igb0.
<br>
<br>As well as during start-up, when cbsd will sets the necessary IP for jail on interface, when you stop them cbsd unset IPs from the interface automatically. Therefore, be extremely careful -
If you set by mistake IP address of the node for jail , then, during the cbsd jstop sequence, cbsd execute
<br>
<br>ifconfig <iface> <ip> -alias
<br>
<br>and a node will be lost in the network.
<br>
<br>To the stop of management IP address, the interface= param can be commented out or removed, or the value is left blank:
<br>
<br>interface=""
<br>
<br>In this case , cbsd will immediately start the jail with the appropriate IP, meaning that he has already been initialized . Such a situation may be necessary when
server has only one IP address, and you plan to run jail ( or a few jails ) in one existing IP, but with the services within that do not conflict
the ports.
<br>For example, having one IP address , you can start jail with WEB server on port 80 , another jail with the mail server on port 25 and so on.
<hr>
<pre>
ver="10.0";
</pre>
Version of the base for jail. Is directly related to the version of FreeBSD. Thus, if the jail are have in rc.conf options
<br>
<br>arch="amd64"
<br>ver="10.0"
<br>baserw=0
<br>
<br>then at the start of the jail ${workdir}/basejail/base_amd64_10.0 will be selected
<br>
<br>When
<br>
<br>arch="i386"
<br>ver="9.1"
<br>baserw=0
<br>
<br>it will accordingly be used ${workdir}/basejail/base_i386_9.1.
<br>
<br>This way you can switch the version of base from one version to another
<br>
<br>When baserw=1 means that the entire base has been initialized and is filled from ${workdir}/jails-data/$jname-data, so that these parameters do not matter
<hr>
<pre>
basename="";
</pre>
The base name. You can create a customized base, for example to build a minimal environment and place it to
<br>$workdir/base_lite_amd64_9.2
<br>
<br>To specify cbsd that you need to mount this directory, basename must have "lite" prefix:
<br>
<br>basename="lite";
<hr>
<pre>
baserw="0";
</pre>
When 1, it is understood that a jail has its own base file system and has an entry.
<br>Typically, this parameter is set during the creation of the jail. If you originally created the jail with baserw=0 (readonly), but want to
switch it into a baserw=1 mode, you first need to copy all the files from the base directory to $workdir/jails-data/$jname-data. For example:
<br>
<br>cd /usr/jails/basejail/base_amd64_10/
<br>pax -p eme -X -rw . /usr/jails/jails-data/jail1-data
<br>
<br>or, if you have in the master node object files:
<br>make -C /usr/src installworld DESTDIR="/usr/jails/jails-data/jail1-data"
<br>
<br>In the same way, at this stage, it is supposed to update the jail that operate in baserw=1, since each cell has a personal copy of the base.
<br>In contrast, when using baserw=0, you can only use one copy of the base, which is mounted through nullfs in read-only to all jails.
<br>You can have one base (eg the minimum amount called lite) for a few tens of jails which is placed on md-ramfs to accelerate the operation of the basic tools in the jails.
<br>
<br>In addition, with baserw=0 you have the opportunity to update the version of the base less.
<br>
<br>In addition, the base is mounted in read-only mode gives you extra security if your jail hacked and somebody try to modify the file system - this is simply will not work.
<hr>

<hr>
<pre>
mount_ports="1";
</pre>
Does the mount /usr/ports of the master node in readonly to /usr/ports in jail. 
<br>You can have one copy of ports tree on the master node that is deployed in /usr/ports, and which mount to all jails.
<br>In order to simultaneously compilation of the same port are not conflicted in two or more jails,  in the /etc/make.conf option WRKDIRPREFIX must be sets to for alternate location, such as /tmp (if the jail
has applytpl=1 settings, this is done automatically)
