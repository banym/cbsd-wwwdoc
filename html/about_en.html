<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="-1">
<br><br>
<b>CBSD</b> is a management layer written for the <a href="www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+9.1-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html">jail(8)</a> subsystem, aimed at unifying racct(8), vnet, zfs(8), carp(4), hastd(8) in one tool and providing a more comprehensive solution for building and deploying applications quickly with pre-defined software sets with minimal configuration.
<br><br>
No extra OS functionality has been exposed yet, and everything that <b>cbsd</b> can do, you could also run manually with tens or hundreds of commands in the CLI using the underlying utilities (Not that you would want to!)

<br><br>
Features:
<br><br>
<li> Fast deployment of jails from scratch
<li> Import and export to and from images
<li> Cloning and migration (including to remote nodes)
<li> Snapshots using ZFS
<li> Traffic Accounting and Resource Utilisation Information (per-jail)
<li> Resource Management: Priorities (re-nice), RACCT/RCTL, File Quoatas
<li> Remote Replication
<li> Jail Distributions (jail with a certain set of software and services)
<li> Web Interface and Centralized Management

<br><br>Why FreeBSD, why jail, why sh, why...?":
<br>
<br>FreeBSD Jails were chosen for several reasons:
<br><li>Zero Virtualization Overhead: Without VIMAGE, the jail code is a very simple design.
<br><li>Security: "divide and conquer". It is desirable for each service or group of services to be isolated.
<br><li>Efficient Environment Replication: Systems engineers often have to deploy lots of similar environments - AMP, MTA, KDE4. At some point you want environments created and configured in advance. Jails allow you to deploy new environments into operation instantly. It also allows the creation of environments that differ from their master template only in configuration, such as different package sets.
<br><li>Speed of deployment and convenient backups.
<br><li>Building your own jail library with customizable options via <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html">FreeBSD ports</a>
<br><br>
Most of the code has been written in <b>sh</b>, since there are no demands for complex logic, it is primarily used to automate what was otherwise manual repetition of commands on the console and is designed to work with external utilities such as: zfs, zpool, sudo, pkg, rsync, etc. Areas that require optimization and specific components such as logtail, replication, node watching daemon are written in C for performance.
<br><br>
cbsd depends on the following  software: <b>rsync</b>,<b>sudo</b>,<b>libssh2</b>,<b>sqlite3</b>
