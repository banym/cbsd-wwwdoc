Due to the fact that the course taken by CBSD is focused on a large number of functional relationship for the provision 
of an integrated solution, the system for their work makes or proposes to make a number of specific settings, 
and what is described on this page.

<br><br>
<center><h3><b>/etc/rc.conf</b> file and <b>rcshutdown_timeout</b> parameter</h3></center>

This parameter adjusts the time of processing the sequence of shutdown rc.shutdown files - 
if after this timestop the process does not transfer control system would kill him. 
For servers having a large number of jails, which in turnmay work to stop the long and sensitive to 
killing services (eg database), the default value (120) is extremely small. In this regard, 
<b>cbsd</b> change it at the first initialization.

If you want to keep the default value and stop the redefine parameter when <b>cbsd initenv</b>, 
simply duplicate the parameter value from /etc/defaults/rc.conf: <b>cbsd</b> will not change the setting if /etc/rc.conf, he already has.

<br>
<center><h3><b>/etc/rc.conf</b> file, default sshd port and sshd_flags paramete</b></h3></center>

As in the case with <b>rcshutdown_timeout</b> in <i>/etc/rc.conf</i>, 
in absence of a <i>/etc/rc.conf</i> parameter <b>sshd_flags</b>, 
<i>cbsd initenv</i> prompts you to change the port (22) default daemon <b>sshd</b> 
on port 22222 by running it through this setup:

<pre>
  sshd_flags="-oPermitRootLogin=without-password -oPasswordAuthentication=yes -oUseDNS=no -p22222"
</pre>

Be extremely careful about this change. 
If you want to keep the standard flags sshd daemon, duplicate entry for sshd_flags from file /etc/defaults/rc.conf in 
/etc/rc.conf and cbsd will not offer change.
<br>
Options "PermitRootLogin=without-password -oPasswordAuthentication=yes" will allow cbsd 
execute a script on remote node with root authority authorizing through the RSA/DSA/ECDSA. 
Currently, work <ins>base</ins> functional cbsd not required, but may be required in conjunction <b>cbsd</b> and mass control configurations system, 
such as <a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/"><b>Ansible</b></a> as will be described in a separate article.
<br><br>
22222 instead of the default port 22 is proposed to change some the following reasons:
<br><br>
<li> to this port comes less scanners for sshd bruteforce. Of course, this argument is not serious ;-) and if you want protection from brute force, just look at utilities <b>security/{bruteblock,denyhosts}</b>;
<li> Ideology of <b>cbsd</b> with nodes implies a connection between a server via ssh and it is desirable that a unique/selected port sshd (in this case 22222), always identified <b>sshd</b> serving <ins><b>node</b></ins>.
In practice, different ports sshd on the master node and jail is useful because if you suddenly forget what kind of node on running your jail <b>jail1024.my.domain</b>, 
you can always be sure that when connecting to the host <b>jail1024.my.domain</b> on the 22222 port you will certainly get to the physical node serving this jail. 
The second point - that the jail with the parameter <i>oninterface=0</i> and have the same basic system with IP.
<br><br>
Also note that, while parameter <b>applytpl=1</b> and the creation of new jail, <b>cbsd</b> in the same way configures port in jail to port 2222 (however, sshd_enable default remains in NO).
This change is also driven by a desire to identify jail unique port number. That, in turn, are useful for configuration management systems, such as
<a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/"><b>Ansible</b></a>, introducing the names of jail in a single domain (eg jail1024.<b>j</b>.my.domain) and use the mask of <b>.j.</b> in the zone 
system will apply certain filters to know the correct port for establishing a connection. A similar example of <b>cbsd</b> and <b>Ansible</b> will be described in a separate article.
<br>
<center><h3><b>/var/cron/tabs/root</b> file and cbsd periodic</h3></center>
<br>
<b>cbsd</b> may have "internal" tasks requiring periodic execution (eg: traffic stats, <b>RACCT</b> stats or execute <b>sar</b> script). To do this, it leaves a record of the form:
<pre>
* * * * * /usr/bin/lockf -s -t0 $workdir/ftmp/periodic_minutes /usr/sbin/periodic minutes > /dev/null 2>&1
0 * * * * /usr/bin/lockf -s -t0 $workdir/ftmp/periodic_hourly /usr/sbin/periodic hourly > /dev/null 2>&1
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lockf -s -t0 $workdir/ftmp/cbsdsar /usr/local/bin/cbsd cbsdsar > /dev/null 2>&1
</pre>
in user-cron tab for user <b>root</b>. Users cron tab, instead of the system used for the reasons described 
in <a href="html/articles/upgrade_for_fun.html"> Do not be afraid mergemaster</a>. If you do not want to disturb these calls in your system, just open the editor via cron tab command:
<pre>
% crontab -e
</pre>
and put before these lines the '#' comment character. In this case, <b>cbsd initenv</b> will not make changes.
<br>
<center><h3><b>/boot/loader.conf</b> file, pf/ipfw modules and net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept</h3></center>
<br>
