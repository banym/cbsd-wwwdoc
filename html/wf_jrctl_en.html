<b>Description</b>:
<br><br>
To view the statistics, set and unset limits on the jail, use the command cbsd jrctl.
<br>This command with the keys:
<pre>
% cbsd jrctl mode=apply  ...
</pre>
<pre>
% cbsd jrctl mode=unset  ...
</pre>

automatically called for the install or removal of limits when working <b>jstart</b> or <b>jstop</b> respectively.

By command
<pre>
% cbsd jrctl mode=show
</pre>

you can see current statistics on the jail resources consumed, which can be used to generate reports and graphs
for loading jail, as well as the cbsd daemon used to generate recommendations on the need to add new resources and for overload warnings.

By jrctl you can set the following limits jail:

a) All you can do a framework FreeBSD <a href="http://man.freebsd.org/rctl/8">rctl(8)</a>:
<pre>
cputime 	   CPU time, in seconds
datasize	   data size, in bytes
stacksize	   stack size, in bytes
coredumpsize	   core dump size, in bytes
memoryuse	   resident set size, in bytes
memorylocked	   locked memory, in bytes
maxproc 	   number of processes
openfiles	   file descriptor table size
vmemoryuse	   address space limit, in bytes
pseudoterminals    number of PTYs
swapuse 	   swap usage, in bytes
nthr		   number of threads
msgqqueued	   number of queued SysV messages
msgqsize	   SysV message queue size, in bytes
nmsgq		   number of SysV message queues
nsem		   number of SysV semaphores
nsemop		   number of SysV semaphores modified in a single semop(2) call
nshm		   number of SysV shared memory segments
shmsize 	   SysV shared memory size, in bytes
wallclock	   wallclock time, in seconds
</pre>
<br>
<p>b) Set the priority level of one over the other jail  <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=renice&sektion=8">renice(8)</a>, for example,
you may want to give for jail with distcc lowest priority, while the jail with HTTP server - the middle priority, and the jail with the database - is high priority.
<br>
<p>c) In the case of file system ZFS, set a quota on the use of the file system.
