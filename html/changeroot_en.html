When a new jail is created or obtaining from the repository, make it a rule ALWAYS change the user's password <b>root</b> in jail, 
even if you do not plan to run it ssh/ftp/rsh and similar services. If the jail is created with applytpl=0, by default <i>/etc/{passwd,master.passwd,group}</i> 
 in the jail as the original "clean" files FreeBSD, so password of <b>root</b> user is empty. 
 If jail created with applytpl=1 (it also refers to images from repository) <i>$workdir/share/jail-skel</i>
files will be used as templates  where root password is <b>'cbsd'</b>.
