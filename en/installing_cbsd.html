	<h2><a name="req">Installing cbsd</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Since <strong>CBSD</strong> — it's only a number of simplifying the work with the jails scripts, fits any hardware on which the start FreeBSD. It is assumed that cbsd is installed on a clean, freshly installed FreeBSD, because the setting is a number of configuration files <a href="custom_freecbsd.html" target="_blank">was changed</a>. For full work is desirable:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>FreeBSD version greater or equal of 9.1-RELEASE.</li>
			<li><strong>amd64</strong> architecture, because the development is carried out under it.</li>
			<li>ZFS file system, because the use of a number of possibilities offered by ZFS.</li>
			<li>kernel with RACCT/RCTL and VIMAGE support (<strong>CBSD</strong> can fetch out a kernel from own repository with your consent)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h2><a name="version">CBSD versioning</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
		  <p>The first two digits of the cbsd version related to FreeBSD versions for which it was developed and tested. Version 9.2.0 means that scripts were written for FreeBSD 9.2. The third number figure means the cbsd version.</p>
	</div>
	<h2><a name="preparing">Installation and preparation CBSD</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>1) Installing</p>
		<p>a) cbsd can be install via FreeBSD ports tree:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% make -C /usr/ports/sysutils/cbsd install
		</pre>
		<p>or from repository:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% pkg install cbsd
		</pre>
		<p>or</p>
		<p>b) after installing the required dependencies: <strong>libssh2, sudo, rsync, sqlite3</strong></p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% make -C /usr/ports/security/sudo install
			% make -C /usr/ports/security/libssh2 install
			% make -C /usr/ports/net/rsync install
			% make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlite3 install
			% make -C /usr/ports/devel/git install
		</pre>
		<p>get the latest version of <strong>CBSD</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github</a>:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% git clone https://github.com/olevole/cbsd.git /usr/local/cbsd
		</pre>
		<p>2) First run</p>
		<p>If you are installing <strong>CBSD</strong> not from ports, you must first create a cbsd user's with home directory selected as the directory that will contain your jails (in this example — <em>/usr/jails</em>)
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			%  pw useradd cbsd -s /bin/sh -d /nonexistent -c "cbsd user"
		</pre>
		<p>besides, create links of rc.d scripts to start cbsd at system startup (when installing from ports it is unnecessary)</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% cd /usr/local/etc/rc.d
			% ln -s /usr/local/cbsd/rc.d/cbsdd
			% ln -s /usr/local/cbsd/rc.d/cbsdrsyncd
		</pre>
		<p>In classical installation, cbsd contains in two copies. One of them (<em>/usr/local/cbsd</em>), contains a distribution kit, an initial code and configuration files by default. Also, this copy can be used for management of jails in case the main copy is damaged (for example was incorrectly updated).  The index of with what catalog of scripts to work is the environment variable <strong>workdir</strong>.</p>
		<p>For initialization of a working (main) copy of cbsd, use <strong>initenv</strong> command, with which start in the first call it is necessary to specify through an environment variable <strong>workdir</strong> the location of the working directory, and answer a series of questions. The file system for <strong>CBSD</strong> (or rather, the directory <strong>jails-data</strong>in it) should be sufficient to accommodate the jail data. After finalizing the place where the put working directory, first set it as home directory for cbsd user (in this case the working directory in /usr/jails):</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
 			%  pw usermod cbsd -d /usr/jails
		</pre>
		</p>
		<p>3) Initialization with the working catalog into <em>/usr/jails</em>:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% env workdir="/usr/jails" /usr/local/cbsd/sudoexec/initenv
		</pre>
		<p>At the first start dialogue a question-answer on the main settings of a node will proceed.  The expected user input system writes  as an example (e.g.). By pressing Enter with not filled value system will be used value from example. After each updating cbsd, initenv it is necessary to cause again. The next times of initenv can be started through cbsd without <strong>env</strong>(settings of the working dir will be stored in <em>/etc/rc.conf</em>).</p>
		<p>At the first initialization the following questions can meet:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Please fill nodename</strong> — Node name. If there will be a work with several nodes, this name should be unique. It is recommended to use a name, similar full hostname (including domain). This name is used at work with data of servers with remote hosts. Example: node1.my.domain.</li>
			<li><strong>Please fill nodeip</strong> — Working and static IP address of a node. It shouldn't be alias and it is desirable to register this IP on the separately interface (free from any other except a management-traffic). For example: 192.168.1.2</li>
			<li><strong>Please fill nodeloc</strong> — Information strings. It will be used in the future in the WEB interface. Here it is possible to leave information on a geographical place of this nodes. For example: USA, Dallas DC.</li>
			<li><strong>Please fill jnameserver</strong> — List of IP DNS servers for installing in <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em> of created and jails which starts. If several addresses, they must be specified separated by commas. Recommended to setup the master-node server for caching DNS queries. For FreeBSD < 10.0 you prompted for <strong>named</strong> by default, for FreeBSD 10.0+ — it is <strong>unbound</strong>. In order for jail to use <strong>named</strong>, it is necessary to <em>/etc/namedb/named.conf</em> change the line:
			<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
				listen-on       { 127.0.0.1; };
			</pre>
			to
			<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
				listen-on       { any; };
			</pre>
			Accordingly, when using a caching DNS, if the IP address of the node such as 192.168.1.2, use this address in jnameserver at the first.</li>
			<li><strong>Please fill nodeippool</strong> — The list of subnets in which it is permitted to be started the jails. If networks more then one — use spacel as delimer. For example: 10.0.0.0/24 192.168.1.128/29</li>
			<li><strong>Please fill natip</strong> — Here it is necessary to enter the IP address which will represent itself as NAT for private addresses. Usually it is IP of your node. For example: 192.168.1.2</li>
			<li><strong>Please fill fbsdrepo</strong> — Whether to use an official repository of FreeBSD for base/templates. The answer 1 or 2 is expected. If on officidal FreeBSD servers  base it is not revealed — cbsd repository is used.  For example: 1.</li>
			<li><strong>Please fill zfsfeat</strong> — Whether to use possibilities of file system ZFS (clones, snapshots). The answer 1 or 2 is expected. The question won't be, if the system is started not on ZFS.</li>
			<li><strong>Configure NAT for RFC1918 Network?</strong> — Whether to use network address translation (NAT) for private addresses? When jails are created in RFC1918 networks, it is necessary to enable for internet access. For example: 1.</li>
			<li><strong>Which one NAT framework should be use: [pf or ipfw]</strong>- What tool for NAT to prefer. Recommended — pf. For example: 1</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="warning">
		<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Later on, these settings can be changed via the command <strong>cbsd initenv-tui</strong>, or in a file <em>${workdir}/var/db/local.sqlite</em>, which is a SQLite3 database.</p>
