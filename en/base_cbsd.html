<b>commands</b>:<br>
<pre>
% cbsd csup
% cbsd buildworld
% cbsd installworld
</pre>

<i>remark</i>: by the "base" will be meant as the catalog containing full copy/hierarchy of FreeBSD OS files.
<br><br>
For creation of a new jails (or the start jails which base is mounted in RO required), the copy of base is necessary.
Below steps for getting the initial FreeBSD sources from SVN repository of the project (<a href="http://svn.freebsd.org/">http://svn.freebsd.org</a>), its compilation and installation in the separate 
directory which will act as base are described. These actions can be demanded, if you don't want to use already
builded version available on resources <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org</a> and <a href="http://bsdstore.ru">http://bsdstore.ru</a> (for example security reason. It is
untrusted resource), which can be received via 
<b>cbsd repo</b> command. Also, building by hands it is possible to get not only releases, but also intermediate branches variants.

<br><br>buuilding or updating consists of three steps: 
<br>
<h3>1) Receiving or updating of the initial FreeBSD source code through <b>cbsd csup</b>:</h3>
Receiving or updating of an source code for that FreeBSD version at which in the moment works the current node:
<pre>
% cbsd csup
</pre>
Receiving or updating of an source code for the concrete FreeBSD version, for example, for 9.2:
<pre>
% cbsd csup ver=9.2
</pre>
Receiving or updating of source code for STABLE (for example, for RELENG_9):
<pre>
% cbsd csup ver=9 stable=1
</pre>
These commands, at existence of source code in SVN, will fill catalogs <b>$workdir/src/src_$ver</b>
<h3>2) Compilation of source code via <b>cbsd buildworld</b>:</h3>
The result received from a step 1, can be used for base compilation.
World compilation, at existence <b>$workdir/src/src_$ver</b> dir for current node version:
<pre>
% cbsd buildworld
</pre>
Thus, objective files, at existence from the last build, won't be cleaned (make clean).
If in the repeated builds there was a unsuccess, it is meaningful to force to clean old system <b>.o</b>-files with clean params:
<pre>
% cbsd buildworld clean=1
</pre>
By default, multiline assembly, where number of <b>job</b>s equally to number of cores (sysctl -n hw.ncpu).
The num ofr parallel jobs is regulated through the <i>maxjobs</i> parameter, for example, for build in one job:
<pre>
% cbsd buildworld maxjobs=1
</pre>
At compilation, the personal <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=src.conf&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+9-current&arch=default&format=html">src.conf(5)</a> can be used ,
in which it is possible to specify standard KNOBS-y. The src.conf file should placed in the catalog $workdir/etc/ and have name <b>src-</b><i>basename</i><b>.conf</b>, where basename - any name of configuration.
For example, in default cbsd installation there are file <b>/usr/jails/etc/src-lite.conf</b>. For base build with certain src.conf, it is necessary to specify <i>basename</i> parameter:
<pre>
% cbsd buildworld basename=lite
</pre>
The next operation over building result (installworld), also should contain <i>basename=</i> parameter, as the result of building will be placed in <b>$workdir/basejail/base_$basename_$arch_$ver</b> directory,
where $basename - is name of configuartion.
<br><br>Other params of  buildworld:<br><br>
<li><i>ver</i>  - to specify the concrete version of source code
<li><i>arch</i> - build for concrete architecture
<li><i>stable</i> - build for RELENG_X branch
<br>
<h3>3) base installation via <b>cbsd installworld</b>:</h3>
The result received from a step 2, it is possible to use for installation of the new base in <b>${workdir}/basejail/base_*</b> directory, from where it will be already mounted in the RO mode, or to be formed a new jails.
For install of files for the current version of system:
<pre>
% cbsd installworld
</pre>
Installation of files for version 9.2 builded with src.conf named as <i>lite</i>:
<pre>
% cbsd installworld basename=lite ver=9.2
</pre>
other params for installworld:
<br><br>
<li><i>arch</i> - install for concrete architecture
<li><i>stable</i> - install for RELENG_X branch
<br><br>
When you have the base in <b>${workdir}/basejail</b>,you can go to the <a href="/html/wf_jcreate_ssi_en.html">jail creation</a>.
