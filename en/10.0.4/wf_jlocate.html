		<strong>Description</strong>:
		<p>In the case of a few FreeBSD/cbsd node farm, you can generate a map of location jails on the appropriate servers. This functionality uses a utility jlogin search for remote jails. Also, this map can use a variety of tools, such as to custom admin panel, for auto-documentation of the farm, as well as a variety of services (for example, Bacula jail can automatically search for it on the map new jail and to create for them a configuration for backup; or when jail migrate from one physical node to another, reconfigure the target host with jails for backup without system administrator manual action).</p>
