	<p>The command <strong>cbsd node mode=list</strong> show name of the nodes RSA which keys were received through <strong>cbsd node add</strong>. Too most it is possible to receive, having seen the catalog <em>$workdir/.rssh</em>, in  which there are keys. The deduced list doesn't mean that the available key is actual or communication with a node is available (for these tasks there is a special demon <strong>nodepinger</strong>)</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% cbsd node mode=list
		</pre>
		<p class="text-center"><img src="/img/nodelist1.png" alt="" /></p>
