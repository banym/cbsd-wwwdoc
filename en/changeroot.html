When a new jail is created or obtaining from the repository, make it a rule ALWAYS change the user's password <b>root</b> in jail, 
even if you do not plan to run it ssh/ftp/rsh and similar services. If the jail is created with applytpl=0, by default <i>/etc/{passwd,master.passwd,group}</i> 
 in the jail as the original "clean" files FreeBSD, so password of <b>root</b> user is empty. 
 If jail created with applytpl=1 (it also refers to images from repository) <i>$workdir/share/jail-skel</i>
files will be used as templates where root password is <b>'cbsd'</b> in default <b>cbsd</b> installation.
You can change default root password when new jail is created via edit of hash in skel master.passwd via
<pre>
% vipw -d ${workdir}/share/jail-skel/etc
</pre>
commands, or specify alternative path to jail-skel dir in .jconf (jcreate tools) config
