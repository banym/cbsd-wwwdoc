<b>Description</b>:
<br><br>
<b>cbsd jcoldmigrate</b> does cold (with stoping) migration jail from one node to another.
Argmument <b>node</b> point for destination node. Preliminary, RSA/DSA key for remote node must be added via
 <b>cbsd node mode=add</b> operation. Also, on a remote node service rsyncd should work (<b>cbsdrsync</b>).
<br><br>
By default, the jail status on a new node is inherited - if the jail worked, it also will be 
automatically started on a new node. If the jail didn't work - remains in Off status.
To operate, what status should be on a remote jail not is dependent on a condition on the original, it is possible
through parameter <b>start</b>.
<br><br>
Jail on the source, after successful <b>jcoldmigrate</b> will be stoped and switch to <b>Slave</b> status (unregister). 
In rc.conf file of jail on the destination node there will be a record where this jail came from
<br><br>
Notes: For jcoldmigrate, the next action is performed (in process they pass automatically and aren't visible)<br><br>
<li>copy configuration files to remote node, status of jail set to Slave on remote node (<b>cbsd j2prepare</b>)
<li>exec rsync, which does a full copy of the directory with data to remote node (<b>cbsd j2slave</b>)
<li>stop jails (if running) on the source node (<b>cbsd j2slave</b>)
<li>one more rsync job, for synchronization of those files which be modified
<li>switch jail status on source to Slave (<b>cbsd jswmode</b>)
<li>switch jail status to master on the remote node (<b>cbsd rexe + jswmode</b>)
<li>If jail was running - start jail on remode node (<b>cbsd rexe + cbsd jstart</b>)
<br><br>
<b>Example</b> (make cold migration for jail amp123 to netsnap node):

% cbsd jcoldmigrate node=netsnap jname=amp123
