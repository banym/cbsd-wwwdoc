<b>Commands</b>:<br>
<pre>
% cbsd node mode=list
</pre>

The command <b>cbsd node mode=list</b> show name of the nodes RSA which keys were received through
<b>cbsd node add</b>. Too most it is possible to receive, having seen the catalog <b>$workdir/.rssh</b>, in 
which there are keys. The deduced list doesn't mean that the available key is actual or communication with a node
is available (for these tasks there is a special demon <b>nodepinger</b>)
