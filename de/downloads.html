These images may be of a "blocks" of which you can collect the necessary infrastructure. You are limited only by physical server resources, on the exhaustion which can always be another node of the jails and migrate to it. Each image represents archive of jail with the necessary software and minimum templates of configuration files that fulfills helper applying the initial input of user data (eg application administrator's password ) for the application to launch as quickly as possible. Subsequently to work with the jail, accompanied by configuration and software can be a standard way&nbsp;â€” it is independent from <strong>CBSD</strong>. All helpers can work on non-interactively (all possible arguments available command <strong>--help</strong>), being an example of mass construction and Application Server deployment of jails automatically.
